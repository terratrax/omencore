**Progress update (2025-12-28):**
- Initial provider wiring implemented (`IRgbProvider`, `RgbManager`). Providers registered in priority order: **Corsair → Logitech → Razer → SystemGeneric**.
- **Corsair**: `CorsairRgbProvider` added; supports `color:#RRGGBB` and `preset:<name>`; unit tests added and passing. Added direct HID improvements: retries, heuristics, diagnostics, failed-device tracking, and **full-device keyboard writes for K70/K95/K100**, plus a **K100 per-key payload stub** so many keyboards can be controlled without iCUE and we have a path to per-key features. A Settings toggle (`CorsairDisableIcueFallback`) and corresponding tests were added to allow users to opt into HID-only mode.
- **Logitech**: `LogitechRgbProvider` implements `color:#RRGGBB@<brightness>` and `breathing:#RRGGBB@<speed>`; unit tests added and passing.
- **Razer**: Basic `RazerRgbProvider` wraps `RazerService` for Synapse-aware behavior (placeholder for Chroma SDK integration).
- **SystemGeneric**: `RgbNetSystemProvider` added (experimental) using RGB.NET; initialization and basic color application validated in tests.
- Added unit tests for providers and Corsair HID helpers; all related provider and HID tests pass locally (see `OmenCoreApp.Tests/TestResults/test_results.trx`).

**Note / Next steps:** Add telemetry opt-in for anonymous PID success counts and continue DPI/macro HID research for mice support.

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Why Start with System Tray + System Optimizer?

1. **System Tray Fix (Phase 1.1)** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Currently has visible bugs (white margins, icon issues)
   - Quick visual win that improves user perception
   - Low risk - doesn't affect core functionality
   - ~1-2 days of work

2. **System Optimizer (Phase 2)** ✅ COMPLETE
   - High user demand (you already have the batch script)
   - Complements existing features (Fan + Thermal + GPU Power + **System Tweaks**)
   - Self-contained - can be developed in parallel
   - Uses familiar C#/.NET APIs (Registry, WMI, ServiceController)
   - Provides immediate value to gaming users
   - ~2-3 weeks of work

3. **RGB Overhaul (Phase 3) - Next**
   - Requires external SDK dependencies
   - Need device images/logos (licensing considerations)
   - More complex with multiple vendor integrations
   - Best done after core stability

4. **Linux (Phase 4) - Later**
   - Requires new project structure
   - Different testing environment
   - Can be parallelized once Windows is stable
